# Point Cloud Tiles

Tiled point clouds provide the foundation data layer for the annotator application.

## Tile Format

The [BaseGeometryTileMessage](https://github.com/Signafy/mapper-models/blob/master/src/main/proto/MapTileLayers.proto) file format is supported. It is generated by [RegisteredScansToTiles](https://github.com/Signafy/Perception/tree/develop/apps/Core/RegisteredScansToTiles). Tiles are delivered by a tile service; see below for details.

_The [PointCloudTileMessage](https://github.com/Signafy/mapper-models/blob/master/src/main/proto/PointCloudTileMessage.proto) format is deprecated and no longer supported by Annotator._

### Configuration

    tile_manager.utm_tile_scale: [8, 8, 8]

## Super Tiles

Super tiles are the unit of loading and caching sets of tiles. Read all about them [in the code](../src/annotator-entry-ui/tile/TileManager.ts). Each super tile should contain between one and perhaps thirty tiles, depending on tile size and density. Super tile dimensions are specified in the same units (meters) as tiles.

### Configuration

    tile_manager.super_tile_scale: [16, 8, 16]

### Performance

Depending on the number of tiles and density of the point cloud you may need to tweak these settings.

    tile_manager.initial_super_tiles_to_load: 8
    tile_manager.maximum_super_tiles_to_load: 10000
    tile_manager.maximum_points_to_load: 1000000
    tile_manager.sampling_step: 1

## Stream Tiles From A Service

In the app's interactive mode the camera center line intersects with the ground plane to define a point of interest. A rectangular area of interest is built around the center point, and any super tiles that intersect the AOI get loaded. In live mode (or fly-through mode), the area around and in front of the the car (that is the current pose) get loaded.

Annotator streams tiles from a service which should be running on localhost. See [the docs](tile_service.md) to set it up.

### Configuration

    annotator.area_of_interest.enable: true
    annotator.area_of_interest.size: [20, 10, 20]

## Debugging

The bounding boxes show the extents of the point cloud (red box) and area-of-interest for streaming tiles (green box).

    annotator.draw_bounding_box: true

The axes helper shows the location and orientation of the origin of the rendering engine's 3D coordinate system. (red=x, green=y, blue=z)

    annotator.axes_helper_length: 10

The compass rose points north in an earth-oriented coordinate system. It floats at the north end of the point cloud bounding box.

    annotator.compass_rose_length: 50
