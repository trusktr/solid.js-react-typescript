# Annotator

This is a web-based GUI to allow humans to visualize point cloud data sets and to mark up vector features on top of them.

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js (includes npm)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Private NPM repository
Set up a [personal account](https://www.npmjs.com/signup).

Get access to the @mapperai NPM repository, with your NPM username, from [Alonso](alonso@mapper.ai). Then store your credentials locally so that npm can find them:

    npm adduser --scope=@mapperai --always-auth

### Install application dependencies for testing on the host system
    brew install zeromq
    brew install pkgconfig
    npm install

## Configure
The application uses [nconf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nconf) for configuration. It is set up to read configs from [yaml files](packages/config), from environment variables, or from the command line. The command line switch is formatted as `--CONFIG_NAME=CONFIG_VALUE`.

## Build

### Run the incremental compiler
    ./etc/scripts/compile-watch.js 

### Run the [electron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron) debug GUI
    npm run start

or

 - Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
 - Under Run>Runâ€¦, select the Mapper Annotator configuration and run it.

## Rebuild
If you pull down the latest version of the code base and things stop working, try one or more of the following to clear out the caches.

    npm install
    npm rebuild
    ./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild
    ./etc/scripts/compile-watch.js
