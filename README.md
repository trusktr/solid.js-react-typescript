# Annotator

This is a web-based GUI to allow humans to visualize point cloud data sets and to mark up vector features on top of them.

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js (includes npm)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Private NPM repository
Set up a [personal account](https://www.npmjs.com/signup).

Get access to the @mapperai NPM repository, with your NPM username, from [Alonso](alonso@mapper.ai). Then store your credentials locally so that npm can find them:

    npm adduser --scope=@mapperai --always-auth

### Install application dependencies for testing on the host system
    brew install zeromq
    brew install pkgconfig
    npm install

## Configure
The application uses [nconf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nconf) for configuration. It is set up to read configs from [yaml files](packages/config), from environment variables, or from the command line. The command line switch is formatted as `--CONFIG_NAME=CONFIG_VALUE`.

See [the docs](documentation/configuration.md) for details.

## Build

### Run the incremental compiler
    ./etc/scripts/compile-watch.js 

### Run the [electron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron) debug GUI
    npm run start

or

 - Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
 - Under Run>Runâ€¦, select the Mapper Annotator configuration and run it.

## Rebuild
If you pull down the latest version of the code base and things stop working, try one or more of the following to clear out the caches.

    npm install
    npm rebuild
    ./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild
    rm -rf dist
    ./etc/scripts/compile-watch.js 

### gRPC binary
The `electron-rebuild` script installs a `grpc_node.node` binary, among other things. If you get an error like this at runtime:

    Cannot find module '.../node_modules/grpc/src/node/extension_binary/electron-v1.7-darwin-x64-unknown/grpc_node.node'

...you might already have the correct binary, but with the wrong name. Monkey-patch it until we come up with something better. Grab the name of the electron binary directory from the error message, and link it to the electron binary directory that was installed, something like this:

    pushd node_modules/grpc/src/node/extension_binary/
    ln -s electron-v1.7-darwin-x64-\{libc\} electron-v1.7-darwin-x64-unknown
    popd

## Manipulating data

### Point cloud tiles
Point clouds are the foundation of both live visualization and creating annotations. They can be loaded in a batch or streamed in on demand. See [the docs](documentation/point_cloud_tiles.md).

### Annotations
Annotation data is saved locally within this project by default, in `./data`. A set of annotations can be loaded or saved to disk using the menus in the application. There are some shortcuts in [configuration](documentation/configuration.md). Annotation files on disk can be merged in memory by loading them sequentially in the annotator. The application runs an auto-save process for annotations. Those files are in `./data/autosave` if you need them.

### Trajectory play-back
The application can play back a sequence of trajectories to fly through the point cloud. Trajectories are stored in a sequence of [TrajectoryMessage](https://github.com/Signafy/mapper-models/blob/master/src/main/proto/TrajectoryMessage.proto) protobufs, usually found in a `trajectory_lidar.md` file. Trajectory files must be pre-loaded in a [configuration](documentation/configuration.md) setting.
